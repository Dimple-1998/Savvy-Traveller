**Project Description**

This project Savvy Traveler defines a problem to find the most reliable travel route via flight between two cities to arrive on time. This report shows the Savvy Travelerâ€™s algorithm solved using Python language to define a flight route between source and destination cities to arrive on time. This algorithm also helps to find the most reliable travel city by calculating average of each route emerging from city. 

**Problem Statement**

A) Given a graph and two cities, we need to compute the path with the highest probability of on-time arrival. If the path has a single edge, then it will be the probability of that edge. If the path has multiple edges, then multiply all the probabilities. When alternating paths are available, select the one with the highest probability. 

B) Given a graph, for any city we measure the reliability of that city as the sum of all probabilities of on-time arrivals from each other city. The most reliable city is the one with the highest reliability.
